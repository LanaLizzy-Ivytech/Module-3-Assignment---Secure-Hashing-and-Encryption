OpenSSL was not working and had to be removed from the program in order for it to be run.
The cypher one is structured the same as the examples with some small changes. I import random to make the key random to simulate different messages. Alongside the A, Z, and alphabetical check variables is the fix variable. The fix variable allows the program to reverse the cipher. The function contains most of the program, starting with a hold variable results to the for loop, which changes the message to all uppercase to work better. In it, get the cipher math ready and then check if the letter goes out of the alphabet, putting it back into it if it does. Then it adds the character to the results. The result is also put into the fix so it can be called and used. The message is user inputted, but the key is random. Then it calls the function with the message and key. Then it calls the function again, this time with the fix and a negative user key; this reverses the text back to normal.
The SHA-256 was done using the hashlib, as I couldn't find any code or guides on how SHA-256 or the others actually create their hashes. We start by inputting a message. It then hashes by calling sha256 and using the string.encode function to generate the hash string. It then uses print result.hexdigest to make it into a form we could better understand.
